# neural-style-transfer-VGG19
This project combines the content of one image with the artistic style of another image, creating a new image that preserves the content while adopting the style. I will use a pre-trained convolutional neural network to extract features and optimize the generated image to minimize content and style differences.
I have not used any dataset for this project. VGG-19, a 19-layer version of the VGG network has been used in this project. This model has already been trained on the very large ImageNet database and has learned to recognize a variety of low-level features (at the shallower layers) and high-level features (at the deeper layers).
In this project, I have :

Implemented the neural style transfer algorithm
Generated novel artistic images using your algorithm
Define the style cost function for Neural Style Transfer
Define the content cost function for Neural Style Transfer
